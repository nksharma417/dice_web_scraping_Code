# dice_web_scraping_Code
In this repository, we have the code to scrap the data from the dice webstie

This code is quite simple you have two ways two get the data:-

In starting it will ask you the output name for which you want to save the file in your system after that it is just simple

1). By this you can just enter the keyword which may be company name, skills or job title and it will get you the data.
2). By this one, you just enter the url of any location with any job title or anything and it will give you the perfect data you need.

I have wrote this code very simple keeping the thing in mind that anybody can execute it. 

I hope you will understand the code completely.
